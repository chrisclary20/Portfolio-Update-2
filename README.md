## Portfolio Update 
Here is my updated portfolio! While updating my portfolio, I was tasked with linking past projects and making sure the site was mobile responsive. While it could still use more polish, I believe it is a proper working site that you can find plenty of information about me with!
Listed below I have links to my deployed application!
